        <p>In college, I discovered my love for languages. I began translating Spanish poetry for fun and, while interning in Germany, a friend referred me to the <a href="https://www.middlebury.edu/institute" target="_blank">Middlebury Institute of International Studies</a> in Monterey, California. I received my Master’s in German Translation and Interpretation in 2012 and proceeded to work as a legal and financial translator for a small translation company in Frankfurt, Germany, for 3.5 years.</p>
        <p>I currently work freelance as a translator, focusing mainly on transportation-related and business-related texts. Even after all these years, it is supremely satisfying to find just the right word to capture the meaning of the original in a colloquial, fluid English expression.</p>

        <h2>Interpretation</h2>

        </figure>
        <p>Sometimes confused with translation, interpretation is all about receiving and delivering a spoken message. Having been trained as an interpreter, I began interpreting for real-world clients in my second job with the U.S. Department of State. I hit the ground running as a German interpreter for foreign dignitaries visiting the US to learn about our culture, organizations and government.</p>
        <p>When interpreting, I dip into a well of on-the-spot creativity and push my language skills to the limit. It is a demanding job and supremely rewarding when you can help someone share their story with another person who doesn’t speak their language.</p>

        <h2>Project management</h2>

        </figure>
        <p>While I spent some of my time at the Department of State interpreting, I also spent a lot of time doing project management. Supported by amazing colleagues, I worked with a roster of hundreds of contractors to staff dozens of DoS interpreting projects every year.</p>
        <p>During my tenure at DoS, I also took on a lead role in helping facilitate the development of a cloud-based resource management and invoicing system, which was based on the <a href="https://www.servicenow.com" target="_blank">ServiceNow</a> platform. I trained users, created extensive documentation and provided support to my colleagues and to contractors alike. These experiences helped me rediscover my passion for web development.</p>
